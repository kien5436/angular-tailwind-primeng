# Angular boilerplate

This project provide a boilerplate for Angular, hope I wouldn't have to use it.

**What does it do?**

- Provide a *clean* (maybe) project's structure.
- Basic routing with reusable layout or indenpendent page.
- i18n.
- Set up environment.
- Promise based HTTP provider, reduce reliance on `rxjs`. I'll try to avoid it as much as I can.
- Use `primeng` for fastly create component and `tailwindcss` to add utilities classes as needed.
